Hi 

My name is Ifeakachukwu Kelvin Osakwe, I started programming in March 2019 and my first language was Java.

 I remember how I got overwhelmed when I started learning the basics of Java and programming in general. An older friend of mine, who was a Software Engineer recommended a book for me to learn Java.
 
 The book had two parts - the first part touched the fundamental concepts of Java as a language, the second part went advanced and dived deep into some Java topics.
 
 Because of where I was at that time coupled with erratic power supply, I had to dedicate at least one hour a day to learn Java.

It took me about 4 months to get a hold of basic programming concepts and the Java language itself.

I got better with Java, eventually started writing Android apps and I was doing well.

Fast forward to 2020, I added Kotlin to my programming toolbox, and with the same zeal of dedicating few hours a day to learning, I understood Kotlin within a month.

In 2021, I decided to learn Python, and in less than 3 weeks, I understood it. Still in 2021, I added Dart to my toolbox and understood Dart in a week.

What am I trying to say? With all things being equal, the time you use to learn a new programming language is lesser than the time you used to learn the previous one.

Once you understand the general programming concepts, you can easily transfer that knowledge to the next programming language.

Having observed this pattern in my learning, I decided to create this projects study book of some sort. This projects just explains programming using different languages, so you can see that all languages do not differ in concepts. Programming concepts remain the same, whether is Python or Go.

So what are these concepts? here they are:

1. What is the language's Type System - how are Numbers, Characters, Strings, Booleans represented in the language and how do you declare and initialize Variables?
2. Operators - arithmetic, increment & decrement,assignment, equality, type test, logical, boolean and any other types
3. What is Input and Output like, how do you print to the console and how do you receive input from a user?
4. Control Flow - for loop, do-while loop, while loop, if-else, continue, assert, switch, when, return, break
5. How do you handle Exceptions?
6. How do you write Functions - does the language use lambdas, are there any special types of functions?
7. Data Structures - Lists, Array, Set, Map, Collections library
8. Classes - if the language support OOP. How do you represent abstract classes, interfaces, enums? Are there any special types of classes?
9. How do you create Generics ?
10. What is Asynchronous programming like in the language?

Other Concepts :
1. Keywords in a programming language
2. How to Comment code in the language
3. How is the File Structure like, does the language have the concept of Packages or Modules.

I believe these are the things you need to have a grasp of whenever you are learning a programming language. With understanding these concepts in the language, you can be up to speed with building applications using the language.
